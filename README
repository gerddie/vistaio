This library includes the IO and data type part of the 
vista library originaly implemented by 

  Arthur Pope, University of British Columbia 
  Laboratory or Computational Intelligence

Further development was done by Gert Wollny, Marc Tittgemeyer, 
and Heike JÃ¤hnike at the Max-Planck-Institute of Human 
Cognitive and Brain Sciences. 

The library has since been stripped of all code that is not 
related to IO  ad data types and support for storing and 
loading 2d abd 3d vector fields  and critical point sets 
has been added.

The original vista library (converted to the automake build
system) is still available from 
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/mia/files/vista/2.1.7/

This implementation should be able to read all files that were 
stored using the original library. If data is saved to one of the 
original formats the original library should also be able to read 
the files properly.

To compile and install the library, you need 
 * cmake - http://www.cmahe.org 
and a  POSIX compatible C compiler (GNU gcc will do just fine). 

Then after unpacking the software to 
  vistaio-X.X.X one does: 
  cd vistaio-X.X.X
  mkdir build 
  cd build 
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PATH=<prefix> 
  make 
  make test 
  make install 

The "make install" command you may have to run as root. 
The tests cover only the 2d/3dfield loading and storing. 

Remark: 

The vista file format was initially developed on a big-endian machine, 
as a result Arthur Pope decided it is best to store the data in big-endian 
format on the disk. Therefore, if you work on a low-endian machine (e.g. 
all Intel & compatibles) all the data stored in the original formats is 
converted during loading and storing. If, on the other hand you are loading 
or storing to from or to one of the new formats, the data is written in 
low-endian format, but on a big endian machine it will also be automatically 
converted.
